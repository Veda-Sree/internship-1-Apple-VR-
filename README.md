Sentiment Analysis and Visualization

This project utilizes web scraping, API integration, and AI-powered processing to analyze and visualize opinions collected from various online platforms.


 Overview

The goal of this project is to scrape opinion-based data from platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and others using API keys, process the data with OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 for sentiment analysis, and visualize the results using Python's Matplotlib.
